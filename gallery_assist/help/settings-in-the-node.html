I have tried to make everything as intuitive as possible, but someone may not understand. Here are some explanations for the fields.

<strong>Fieldset</strong>: Settings to this Gallery
<ul><li>Show in block: Show the first image of this Gallery in the Gallery Block (read more about Gallery Assist Blocks)</li>
<li>Gallery container weight: Allows the Gallery owner, moderator or administrator to set the position of the Gallery Assist container in relation to the other node fields such as “Body” or CCK fields that have been added</li></ul>

<strong>Sub-fieldset</strong>: Common
<ul><li>Show this gallery as: Sets the layout of the Gallery as a grid (default) or as a list (see examples)</li>
<li>Show titles: Permanently shows the titles in the views</li>
<li>Shadow: Shows CSS-formatted shadows (only supported in Windows)</li></ul>

<strong>Sub-fieldsets</strong>: Teaser container and Page container
<ul><li>Align</li>
<li>Float</li></ul>

I think these last two parameters are self-explanatory--this is not an HTML guide ;.)
