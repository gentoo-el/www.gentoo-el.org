The folder of Gallery Assist should be easy to understand.

A global gallery folder (<strong>gallery_assist</strong>) contains all galleries created through this module.

A gallery user folder (named after the <strong>UID</strong> of the user) contains the galleries belonging to that user.

The gallery presets folders are:
<ul>
<li><strong>img</strong>: contains mini thumbnails for the Gallery Assist pager</li>
<li><strong>thm</strong>: contains thumbnails of the gallery as long as Gallery Assist ImageCache is not installed</li>
<li><strong>prev</strong>: contains the preview images of the gallery as long as Gallery Assist ImageCache is not installed</li>
</ul>

Once <i>Gallery Assist ImageCache</i> is installed, Gallery Assist thumbnails and preview images are not longer produced by the Gallery Assist module. The ImageCache does it instead.
