The Gallery Assist module provides the node type “Gallery” that is already prepared with the necessary functionality.

This functionality can be assigned to all other node types as well, which I call “<strong>assigment</strong>(<strong>s</strong>)” in this documentation.

You can manage the Gallery Assist permissions and combine them using all the possibilities offered by Drupal.

Please pay close attention when sharing permissions to assignments. Users with permission to create galleries in an assignment also need permission to create that node type.

Each assignment can be managed separately.

This module provides you with a broad spectrum of layout options.
