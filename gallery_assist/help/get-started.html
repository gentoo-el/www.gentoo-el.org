Go to "Create content" and select the <a href="own-node-type-and-assigments">Gallery Assist node type</a> called “Gallery” or another node type assigned with <a href="own-node-type-and-assigments">Gallery Assist fuctionality</a>.

Name your article and save it. Gallery Assist will extend the article with a new field or object (the gallery container) and needs this name ID to create the <a href="folder-structure">gallery’s folder structure</a>.

Once the article is saved, click on it to edit it. Two new fieldsets are added to the node edit form:
<ol>
<li><a href="settings-in-the-node">Settings to this Gallery</a></li>
<li><strong>Gallery: Add and edit gallery items</strong> – which will be explained hereafter.</li>
</ol>

Select the files you want to add to this gallery and click “<strong>Update</strong>” to upload them. If the pictures have a copyright, enter information in the <strong>Temp Copyright</strong> field and it will be posted to all the pictures, avoiding unnecessary work.

In the background, the folder structure will be created if it doesn’t already exist. Images are stored, copied and formatted as necessary.

If this process fails, please read the list of possible causes for this issue and post the issue through the Drupal Issues Reporting System (at your account profile on drupal.org).

If the images are successfully uploaded, the form will be rebuilt with new changes.

Now you can:
<ol>
<li>Add new images to the gallery.</li>
<li>Change the captions and copyright information as needed.</li>
<li>Change the order of the pictures by using tabledrag.</li>
<li>Add a description to each image.</li>
</ol>

You can add a description to the gallery, a task that belongs only to the Drupal node process.

Once satisfied, save the node and view it.
