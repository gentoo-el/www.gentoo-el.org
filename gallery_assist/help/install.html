<ol>
<li>Download Gallery Assist from <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gallery_assist">http://drupal.org/project/gallery_assist</a>.</li>
<li>Move the unpacked Gallery Assist folder (gallery_assist) into the same location as your other contributed modules.</li>
<li>Go to Administer > Modules and search in the list for the Gallery Assist entry. Check the checkbox to activate the module and then save the settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The folder “/sites/default/files/gallery_assist” will be created. Gallery Assist also creates folders for any users with permissions allowing them to use the module. Folders named after their UID will be created in the “/sites/default/files/gallery_assist” folder.</p>
<p>I recommend creating a test gallery after installation and before configuring the module. This will give you an idea of how the default settings look.</p>
